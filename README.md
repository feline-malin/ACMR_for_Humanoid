# ACMR_for_Humanoid
This repository contains the implementation of the Actor-Critic Model Reuse (ACMR) framework, a novel approach to transfer learning in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that addresses adaptation challenges when environments undergo significant changes in state-action space dimensions, such as sensor and actuator reduction.
